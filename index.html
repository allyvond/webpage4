               <h1 id="box1">Zumiez 2020 Annual Report</h1>
                
                <p>I chose to recreate the Zumiez 2018 annual report because of the company’s fun nature in their branding and my interest in street/sportswear. The problem was that even though Zumiez sometimes has illustrative bags and stickers, they don’t actually have a lot of centralized branding methods. I could not actually find any branding guidelines online for Zumiez and their website/stores don’t really have much graphic design oriented branding. From my research I concluded that they have an extreme sports style design. This is heavily influenced by skater culture. Even though I’m not necessarily into “extreme sports,” I have always considered Zumiez my favorite store for streetwear apparel. Some of my favorite brands sold there are Teddy Fresh, Fila, Rip n Dip, Odd Future, etc. The interior of Zumiez tries to replicate a teen room with it’s more cluttered and dark nature. With this knowledge, I’ve decided to make an annual report for Zumiez that has a fun illustration style geared towards a teen and young adult demographic. I combine various illustrations of skater culture and patterns to achieve this look. I want the illustrations to look very intentional for every page so I started by laying out the text then making drawings/patterns around the text. I think this definitely helps with the continuity and flow of the book because I’m not just adding pictures to add pictures, I’m creating illustrations off of the pre-existing information. I also include two spreads that highlight different collaborations that have been featured in Zumiez. The first one is an exclusive Zumiez collaboration, 999 club apparel for Juice WRLD. I didn’t design the pattern used on the page, I drew it based on one of the collaboration’s t-shirts. The other collaboration I feature is the second brand collaboration between Teddy Fresh and Rip N Dip, two of Zumiez’s best selling brands. I did not design the logo I feature on the right-hand spread for the collaboration, nor did I design the clothing layout I illustrated on the left-hand spread.</p>

                Bloom is a mock skincare brand I made to show off my design and branding skills. This brand is inspired by most of the skincare products I use because I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin. The design inspiration for this brand actually came from hydrangeas. They are my favorite flower and their color tones are so pretty. The shapes that define the brand are based off of abstracted petals. I made them abstract because I was going for a very modern branding style. I also am currently making a mock website to go with this brand.</p>

                <p>
                 My objective was to make a chocolate bar label that was a homage to another graphic designer. I chose Paul Rand. Some of Paul Rand’s work that I admire the most is his child book cover designs. He has a style that looks very similar to cut paper. For my final design I decided to use his cut paper style to make a cute caterpillar. I thought this went along well with what he usually illustrates because of its content and style. I also tried to arrange the text in a playful manner. The colors of the label are very bright because Paul Rand used to always have his children book works very colorful. The milk chocolate bar has a caterpillar on it, the white chocolate bar has a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon, and the dark chocolate bar has a butterfly on it. I don’t own the images of Paul Rand on the back of the bar, they are from https://paulrand.design</p>

                <p>
                For my typography class, we were assigned with making a sequence book that emphasizes typography. I chose to make my sequence book about how to apply eyeshadow. Inside, there are pictures for each of the steps in black and white that I took. In the book, I frequently  switched between serif and sans serif type(Scala). This was to show the great balance each style of type can achieve when used together. I chose a color palette that I thought should represent a more modern day makeup goer. Blue and pink to show that gender stereotypes are breaking and either color could represent someone who loves makeup. This project was unique to me because style of pamphlet it is. I think it makes for a very interesting portfolio piece.

                <h1 id="box5">Deconstructed: A Poem Book about Design 2019 </h1>
                <p>
                This project is typography based publication called Deconstructed. Each spread has two famous quotes about design or typography. Then, there is a quote that is made of words from each of the two famous quotes. In this book, I tried to add lots of physical qualities to make it look more hand crafted. There are torn pieces of paper textures, crumpled pieces of paper textures, and hand-drawn words. I used stencils to make the hand-drawn words so they were the same font. This book uses hierarchy to emphasize more important words in the quotes from each other. This is created by using different fonts, sizes, and typefaces. I tried to make every page more exciting and unique so that a reader would not get bored with the repetitive nature in the structure of the book.
